We are building a [Scilla](https://scilla-lang.org/) dapp on the
[Zilliqa](https://zilliqa.com/) blockchain to demonstrate essential
functionality of large-scale industrial machine economy as outlined by the [DX3
project](http://dx3os.com/). To enable connectivity with embedded software
running on industrial machines and to offload large quantities of data traffic,
the dapp shall be integrated with an off-chain engine. The dapp will benefit
from the high throughput of the Zilliqa blockchain, and from formal verification
and separation of communication from programming offered by Scilla, which can
lead to an attractive proposition to machine industries looking to expand into
the blockchain space.
